    <p class="font">Jellyfish and sea jellies are the common names given to the medusa-phase of 
        certain gelatinous members of the subphylum Medusozoa, 
        which is a major part of the phylum Cnidaria. 
        Jellyfish are mainly free-swimming marine animals with umbrella-shaped bells and trailing tentacles, 
        although a few are anchored to the seabed by stalks rather than being mobile. 
        The bell can pulsate to provide propulsion for highly efficient locomotion.</p>
